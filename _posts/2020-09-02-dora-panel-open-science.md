Reproducibility is when the same steps are applied to the same data set, it should produce the same results. Reproducibility together with transparency in reporting results are indicators of quality research.

A simple definition that offers us a promising metric for research quality that requires multiple decision-making processes (starting from shaping a research idea, planning, data collection, processing, analysis, publishing, archiving and ensuring that others can build upon our research work, it promotes collaboration over competition. However, I want to draw your attention to a more hidden and invisible work that goes into it. Conducting reproducible research is overwhelming, both resource-wise and skill-wise. And since it is not mandatory for publication, the ultimate reward researchers aim to obtain, these efforts are often led by well-intentioned and self-motivated researchers.

Let’s look at some of the visible work and tangible outcome researchers achieve in conducting and sharing their work openly:
- Visible leaders of the projects might receive recognition for the overall success.
- Numbers of publications and successful grants (mind you, there are way more grant applications that are rejected).
- Growth in community size, for example, if its a software project you can think of the users and collaborators as a community.
- Open source codebase and documents that are available for reuse under a license.
- DOI that most of these research outputs can be attached to and the citations can be counted.

There is obviously more to research work, which is often invisible in research outputs. I have listed some of those hidden and invisible labour that exists in open source communities.
- Shared leadership efforts and pro-active volunteer work.
- People who can communicate science to a larger audience for researchers by citizen and participatory science.
- Staff members who support others, for example, those in core staff positions.
- we hear a lot about accessibility and inclusion and folks who are most affected by a lack of effort in this direction end up carrying the most weight of work done to change the culture in their workplace.
- We are also aware of the archiving and maintenance roles of librarians and members who continue to take care of our research objects even after the research is over and there is definitely no reward for that.
- Teaching and mentoring efforts are completely led by self-motivated and often poorly supported individuals - beyond their work.

Here are some highlights of the challenges that exist in recognizing the contributions of both visible and invisible labour in reproducible and open research:
- Most of these contributions are not fairly incentivized.
- They require specialized skills, that are often not formally taught.
- They need resources which are not equitably available to everyone, especially talking about low-income organizations, communities, and countries.
- Specifically talking about invisible contributions, they are very hard to assess, and many volunteer-led efforts are happening there.
- Finally, even the metrics put in place are not widely adopted.

A few initiatives I want to highlight are DORA, UK’s REF, a newly established hidden REF that aims to recognize hidden labour, CRediT Taxonomy, JOSS for publishing software and CHAOSS metrics that also takes into non-conventional metrics such as diversity and inclusion into account.

We have been hearing this for over a decade that it’s time for a culture change. And I want to add to that the culture change can not truly happen if we fail to recognize less tradition research contributions and disproportionately undermining the important work of research stakeholders who have been previously excluded from being recognised fairly.

I would like to give examples of Open Source projects that I work on: _The Turing Way_ and the Open Life Science.

***[The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome): Online community-led book project on Data Science.***

Let me start by the visible metric of success/assessment that we have in this project: within 1.5 years, we have 27 chapters and 100 subchapters co-authored and supported by over 250 contributors and read and share worldwide by 1000s of people.

Then we also have intentional practices for acknowledgement and contribution assessments, which I have explained in 5 aspects: 

1. **Eligibility**: who is eligible, well anyone interested in contributing to the project is welcome. I believe each of us has some skills that are useful for someone else, and The Turing Way aims to be a vehicle for that.
2. **System of acknowledgement**: As in, dismantling the traditional evaluation metric system, we promote a culture of collaboration and opposite to individual ownership and competitive nature of academia, we promote shared ownership.
3. **Recognition**: Often in open communities, volunteers come and invest their time, skills, and energy in developing the project. 
  - Most open-source projects will deem the “opportunity for people to work” as a value or reward which is not tangible at all. Specifically when these contributors can contribute anymore. Therefore we intentionally create an opportunity for people to record their contribution in a manner that is useful and valuable for them, which is highlighted in the book and is available for people to share in their CV for example. Everyone who develops, not only writes, but also reviews, maintains, and mentors are named as an author of the book.
4. **Quality control**: We have a peer-review system for collaboration and improvement of the contributions made by our contributors.
  - We also support individuals by providing support, creating helpful guidelines that can streamline their work, and multiple opportunities for community-led efforts, collaboration, and engagements.
5. **Community**: where we are deeply committed to providing a welcoming and safe environment and involving people from diverse backgrounds and identities.

**[Open Life Science](https://openlifesci.org/): 16-week long training and mentoring program.**

In the same 5 aspects, in this project:

1. **Eligibility**: We involve folks who have a research idea and they want to lead it in their communities.
2. **System of acknowledgement**: We want to democratize leadership skills for a free and low cost so that it is widely accessible for everyone and not just those who have resources and mean to acquire those skills.
3. For recognition, we largely offer a platform for our members, both for the project leads or mentees to create and highlight their work, and for mentors to get recognition for their inspiring efforts in the open science communities.
    - Of course, visibility without fair compensation is not enough, therefore we are in the process of establishing an honorarium system for all our members.
4. **Recognition**: The quality assessment depends on the commitment and not by the extent someone has developed their projects. There is also peer-networking, mentor guidance, check-ins and certification at the end of each cohort.
5. **Community**: we aim to build a community of community builders who are empowered to design inclusive, not only open, research projects

**I want to close by drawing your attention to the ‘incentives’ that we all talk about, but they are always poorly defined.**

We have to understand, what these incentives are, who are the people who we are designing them for, win what ways this will make their experience in the academic system rewarding? As I provided two separate systems in two different projects - it’s clear that answers to all these questions will vary from project to project and we need to understand that they do not have to be standardized across all research domains and open source communities.

With that, I would like to acknowledge my colleagues and community members from The Turing Way, especially Kirstie and the Open Life Science, Yo, and Berenice. All our resources are available under cc-by 4.0, and you are welcome to join and help us improve how we recognize visible and invisible labour in science.

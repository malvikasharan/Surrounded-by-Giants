## Inclusiveness in Open Science

Science in the 21st century is becoming increasingly collaborative and open in nature. Consequently, the advancement of a research field should be measured not only by scientific output but also by the level of participation of its community members. Hence, a successful community should be able to promote equal participation from its community members independent of the factors such as geographic location, gender, ethnicity, and social background. In my talk, I will explore inclusiveness as one of the key features of the open source community and share some of the lessons learned while adopting them in my work as a community manager.

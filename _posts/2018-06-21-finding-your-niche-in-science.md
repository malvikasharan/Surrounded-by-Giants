## From developing software to building community in bioinformatics

Over the past decade, bio-computational research has advanced rapidly allowing large-scale characterization of genes, transcripts, and proteins, and resulting in a deluge of -omics data. Simultaneously, high-throughput bioinformatic approaches have been developed for the analysis of such data, identifying previously unknown molecules, their interactions, and their functions. I was first introduced to such techniques and the potential of bioinformatics in biological science during my masters at b-it in University of Bonn. This interest in the bio-computational tools, piqued during my masters and internship in Max Planck, inspired me to undertake a PhD at the University of WÃ¼rzburg, leading me to my current position at EMBL Heidelberg. In my talk at the b-it lecture series, here I reflect on the last 8 years and share some of the lessons learned as a computational biologist, while trying to find my niche in science as a community manager.

Here is my [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/malvikasharan/from-developing-software-to-building-community-in-bioinformatics-how-to-find-your-niche-in-science).

Hopefully I will write it in detail in coming days.

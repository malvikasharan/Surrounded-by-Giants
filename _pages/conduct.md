<p>This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within this group as a community of readers, authors, developers, contributors, etc. (see different ways to  <a href="./../participate">participate</a>. It also lists the ways to report unacceptable behavior.</p>

<p>We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. By participating in this community, participants accept to abide by the Code of Conduct and accept the procedures by which any Code of Conduct incidents are resolved. Any form or behaviour to exclude, intimidate or cause discomfort is a violation of the Code of Conduct. To foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all platforms and events:</p>

<li>Use welcoming and inclusive language</li>
<li>Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences</li>
<li>Gracefully accept constructive criticism</li>
<li>Focus on what is best for the community</li>
<li>Show courtesy and respect towards other community members</li>

<p>If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we ask that you report it the owner of this page by emailing <a href="mailto: email.surroundedbygiants@gmail.com">
email.surroundedbygiants@gmail.com</a>. We, the core members of this community, will take the appropriate action to address the situation.</p>

<h3>Our open source community strives to:</h3>

<h4>Be friendly and patient.</h4>

<h4>Be welcoming</h4>
<p>We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not limited to, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience level.</p>

<h4>Be respectful</h4>
<p>Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.</p>

<h4>Be careful in the words that you choose</h4>
<p>we are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>

<li>Violent threats or language directed against another person.</li>
<li>Discriminatory jokes and language.</li>
<li>Posting sexually explicit or violent material.</li>
<li>Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").</li>
<li>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.</li>
<li>Unwelcome sexual attention.
<li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.</li>
<li>Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.</li>

<h4>When we disagree, try to understand why<h4> <p>Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. We must resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of our community comes from its diversity, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.</p>

<p>This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment, and goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.</p>

<h3>Diversity Statement</h3>

<p>We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all. Although we may not be able to satisfy everyone, we all agree that everyone is equal. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong.</p>

</p>Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor all people regardless of their characteristics that include, but are not limited to, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience level. We will not tolerate discrimination or behaviours that exclude people from the community spaces or any related projects.</p>

<h3>Reporting Issues</h3>

<p>If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior—or have any other concerns—please report it by contacting us via <a href="mailto: email.surroundedbygiants@gmail.com">email.surroundedbygiants@gmail.com</a>. All reports will be handled with discretion. In your report please include:</p>

<li>Your contact information.</li>
<li>Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please include them as well. Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger), please include a link.</li>
<li>Any additional information that may be helpful.</li>

<p>After filing a report, a representative will contact you personally. If the person who is harassing you is part of the response team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. A representative will then review the incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to how to respond. We will respect confidentiality requests to protect victims of abuse.</p>

<p>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If an individual engages in unacceptable behavior, the representative may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a permanent ban from our community without warning.</p>
